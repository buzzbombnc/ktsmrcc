# ktsmrcc

This is a basic [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) application that (badly) mimics Reddit.  It was written for the SMR coding challenge.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
